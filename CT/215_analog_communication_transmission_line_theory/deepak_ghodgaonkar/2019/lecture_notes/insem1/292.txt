In basic circuit analysis, we assume the distances between the components to be negligible which is not true.
Thus it might happen that the voltages and currents are not in phase and there might even be time delays across components.

Resistors, capacitors, inductors and the connections between them are considered lumped elements if time delay is negligible.
If the distance is more, they have to be considered as distributed elements. Thus their values to be evaluated at per-unit-distance basis.
