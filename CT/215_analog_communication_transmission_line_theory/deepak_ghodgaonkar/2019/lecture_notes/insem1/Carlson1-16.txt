--> Information transfer basic function of CT

--> Physical manifestation of information as produced by the source = Message

--> Two distinct message categories - analog and digital

--> Analog message = physical quantity varying with time in a smooth and continuous fashion. - needs system with high fidelity

--> Digital Message = ordered sequence of symbols selected from a finite set of discrete elements. - needs higher accuracy

--> conversion of signal to electrical - transducer

--> Transmitter - processes input signal to suit channel - coding and modulation occurs here

--> Channel - Electrical medium bridging source and destination.- introduces loss or attenuation

--> Receiver - operates on output signal to prepare for delivery- amplilfication and demodulation, filtering.

--> Distortion - caused due to imperfect system response to signal.- disappears when signal is turned off.

--> interference - contamination due extraneous signals. -- most often on radios. appropriate filtering can reduce this.

--> Noise - random unpredictable signals. 

--> One has transmitter and other receiver - simplex(SX)

--> Full duplex(FDX) - Requires transmitter and receiver at each end.

--> half-duplex(HDX) - transmission in either direction but not at the same time.

--> Fundamental limitations of I Transmission - bandwidth(as a measure of speed, is finite and thus limit rate of signal variation) and noise.

--> Transmission Bandwidth - ability of system to follow signal variations - usable frequency response.

--> Bandwidth (TV) - several MHz, voice signal - 3KHz. For a signal with 'r symbols'/s B>=r/2.

--> Shannon Harley Law -> C = B*log(1 + S/N) -> rate of information transmission cannot exceed channel capacity.

--> Modulating Signal - message.

--> Sinusoidal Carrier modulation grouped under Continuous-wave(CW) modulation. CW produces frequency translation.

--> in AM message spectrum runs from 100Hz to 5KHz.

--> pulse modulation - pulse amplitude modulation (PAM).

Benefits of Modulation: 

--> Efficiency of transmission depends on frequency of transmitted signal.

--> antenna should have 1/10 of signal's wavelength, thus modulation is required.

--> Fractional Bandwidth - absolute bandwidth/center frequency. If this is within 1-10%, costs and complications are minimized

--> Multiplexing - combining several signals for simultaneous transmission on one channel.
	Frequency Division multiplexing(FDM) uses CW modulation. Time Division Multiplexing(TDM) uses pulse modulation.

--> A variation of multiplexing is multiple access(MA)
